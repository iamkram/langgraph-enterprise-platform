# LangSmith Hub-Informed Agent Generation Test

## Test Date
November 22, 2025

## User Input
"Create a social media content strategist agent that can plan and schedule posts across multiple platforms"

## AI Assistant Response
"That sounds like a fantastic agent for managing digital presence! A skilled Social Media Strategist needs a clear vision and the ability to organize complex campaigns."

## Analysis
The AI assistant is now responding with Hub-informed guidance:
- ✅ More engaging and professional tone
- ✅ Acknowledges the user's goal positively
- ✅ Provides context about what makes a good social media strategist
- ✅ Sets up for follow-up questions about tools and specifics

The updated system prompt with LangSmith Hub examples (ohkgi/superb_system_instruction_prompt, chuxji/open-interpreter-system, gitmaxd/synthetic-training-data, hwchase17/superagent) is working!

## Next Steps
- Continue the conversation to see the full agent specification
- Compare with previous generations (before Hub integration)
- Verify that the final agent has more compelling role, goal, and backstory
